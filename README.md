# Statistical Analysis Methods 

This repository contains Python scripts and sample data files for performing statistical analysis, simulations, and data visualization. It is designed for undergraduate Computational Physics course and demonstrates fundamental statistical methods.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `data.txt` | Sample dataset of house selling prices and house sizes for analysis. |
| `data2.txt` | Sample dataset with student grades and scores used for descriptive statistics and regression examples. |
| `descriptive_statistics.py` | Calculates mean, median, standard deviation, and skewness for multiple datasets. |
| `exponential_clt_simulation.py` | Demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem using exponential random variables and plots the distribution of sample means. |
| `house_price_analysis.py` | Analyzes house price data, calculates average prices, 95% confidence intervals, and visualizes the distribution with a histogram. |
| `lifetime_estimation.py` | Estimates lifetime in a decay process using weighted linear regression. Calculates lifetime uncertainty, chi-square, and reduced chi-square. |
| `linear_regression_anova.py` | Performs simple linear regression on two variables and generates an ANOVA table. Also calculates R² and plots the regression line. |
| `plot_student_histograms.py` | Plots histograms of student grades for different exams and assignments, including normal distribution fitting for visualization. |
| `poisson_distribution.py` | Demonstrates the Poisson distribution by plotting actual and expected frequencies. Calculates average event rate (α) and overlays the expected distribution. |
